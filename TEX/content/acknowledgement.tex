This thesis is a result of my studies at Villanova University and my research as a member of the Center for Resilient Water Systems' PennDOT Hydrology Team. I would like to thank my advisors, Dr.~Robert~Traver, Dr.~Bridget~Wadzuk, and Dr.~Gerald~Zaremba, for their endless support, for sharing their wealth of knowledge and experience, and for entertaining my continuous requests to try new things. Madhat Fares, Danielle Galloway, Shaelynn Heffernan, and Matina Shakya, my fellow graduate students, made field work a breeze and provided many hours of troubleshooting, laughs, bouncing ideas around, and more troubleshooting. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and AECOM's partnership were key in inspiring, funding, and critiquing our work, and I am forever grateful for their support. Last, but certainly not least, thank you to my family for providing a rich educational background and my friends for their encouragement and support along the way.
