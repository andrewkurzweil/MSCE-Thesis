@article{Joshi2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Re-use requires permission from the publisher The modeling of the water flow in soils under non-isothermal conditions requires consideration of the temperature influence on the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The surface-tension-viscous-flow (STVF) theory considers the influence of temperature on viscosity, density and surface tension and provides a conceptual framework for the temperature dependence of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Previous research has shown discrepancies between observed temperature effects on SHPs and the STVF theory. Furthermore, experimental investigations, which investigate the temperature effects on both the retention and conductivity curves in a combined manner, are still rare. To overcome this limitation, we measured the SHPs of three different soils at three different temperatures (5, 20, and 35°C) with the evaporation method, which yields highly resolved retention data in the suction range between saturation and 100 kPa, and conductivity data in the range of ∼6 to 100 kPa. The classic STVF-based model and two alternative models were tested. Results showed that the temperature dependence of SHP was larger than predicted by the STVF theory and depends on the soil. The effect was strongest for the silt loam, followed by the sand and smallest for the sandy loam. Fits of the Grant and Stoffregen models to the experimental data were excellent, but required soil-specific parameters. This indicates that the surface properties of the soil matrix might contribute to the effects of temperature on SHPs.},

abstract = {The perception of the maintenance demands of low impact development (LID) systems represents a significant barrier to the acceptance of LID technologies. Despite the increasing use of LID over the past two decades, stormwater managers still have minimal documentation in regard to the frequency, intensity, and costs associated with LID operations and maintenance. Due to increasing requirements for more effective treatment of runoff and the proliferation of total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements, there is a greater need for more documented maintenance information for planning and implementation of stormwater control measures (SCMs). This study examined seven different types of SCMs for the first 2-4 years of operations and studied maintenance demands in the context of personnel hours, costs, and system pollutant removal. The systems were located at a field facility designed to distribute stormwater in parallel in order to normalize watershed characteristics including pollutant loading, sizing, and rainfall. System maintenance demand was tracked for each system and included materials, labor, activities, maintenance type, and complexity. Annualized maintenance costs ranged from {\$}2,280/ha/year for a vegetated swale to {\$}7,830/ha/year for a wet pond. In terms of mass pollutant load reductions, marginal maintenance costs ranged from {\$}4-{\$}8/kg/year TSS removed for porous asphalt, a vegetated swale, bioretention, and a subsurface gravel wetland, to {\$}11-{\$}21/kg/year TSS removed for a wet pond, a dry pond, and a sand filter system. When nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus were considered, maintenance costs per gper year removed ranged from reasonable to cost-prohibitive, especially for systems with minimal to no nutrient removal. As such, SCMs designed for targeting these pollutants should be selected carefully. The results of this study indicate that generally, LID systems, as compared to conventional systems, have lower marginal maintenance burdens (as measured by cost and personnel hours) and higher water quality treatment capabilities as a function of pollutant removal performance. Cumulative amortized system maintenance expenditures equal the SCM capital construction costs (in constant dollars) in 5.2 years for wet ponds and in 24.6 years for the porous asphalt system. In general, SCMs with higher percentages of periodic and predictive or proactive maintenance activities have lower maintenance burdens than SCMs with incidences of reactive maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {A new method for detecting spikes in acoustic Doppler velocimeter data sequences is suggested. The method combines three concepts: (1) that differentiation enhances the high frequency portion of a signal, (2) that the expected maximum of a random series is given by the Universal threshold, and (3) that good data cluster in a dense cloud in phase space or Poincar{\'{e}} maps. These concepts are used to construct an ellipsoid in three-dimensional phase space, then points lying outside the ellipsoid are designated as spikes. The new method is shown to have superior performance to various other methods and it has the added advantage that it requires no parameters. Several methods for replacing sequences of spurious data are presented. A polynomial fitted to good data on either side of the spike event, then interpolated across the event, is preferred by the authors.},

Many physical phenomena perturb multiple physical variables nearly simultaneously, and so features are identified as time periods in which there are local maxima of absolute deviation in all time series. Unlike other available methods, this method allows the analyst to tune the method using their knowledge of the physical context. The method is applied to a data set from a moored array of instruments deployed in the coastal environment of Monterey Bay, California, and a data set from sensors placed within the submerged Yax Chen Cave System in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico. These example data sets demonstrate that the method allows for the automated identification of features which are worthy of further study.},

abstract = {Soil compaction causes substantial reduction in agriculture productivity and has always been of great distress for farmers. Intensive agriculture seems to be more crucial in causing compaction. High mechanical load, less crop diversification, intensive grazing, and irrigation methods lead to soil compaction. It is further exasperated when these factors are accompanied with low organic matter, animal trampling, engine vibrations, and tillage at high moisture contents. Soil compaction increases soil bulk density and soil strength, while decreases porosity, aggregate stability index, soil hydraulic conductivity, and nutrient availability, thus reduces soil health. Consequently, it lowers crop performance via stunted aboveground growth coupled with reduced root growth. This paper reviews the potential causes of compaction and its consequences that have been published in last two decades. Various morphological and physiological alterations in plant as result of soil compaction have also been discussed in this review.},

With vertical arrays of four and eight three-component geophones in two monitoring wells, respectively, we were able to reliably determine source mechanisms of the strongest events with the best signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysis indicates predominantly non-double-couple source mechanisms with positive volumetric component consistent with opening cracks oriented close to expected hydraulic fracture orientation. Our observations suggest the induced events are directly the result of opening cracks by fluid injection, in contrast to many previous studies where the seismicity is interpreted to be primarily shearing caused by pore pressure diffusion into the surrounding rock or associated with shear stresses created at the hydraulic fracture tip.

We conducted a systematic PubMed search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of precipitation-related floods, among Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Research identifying  flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood, those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-, during, and post-flood.

abstract = {Fault rocks can function as barriers to subsurface fluid flow and affect the storage of CO2 in geological structures. Even though flow across faults often involves more than one fluid phase, it is typically modeled using only single-phase functions due to a lack of fault rock relative permeability data and complexities in incorporating two-phase flow properties into flow simulations. Here we present two-phase fluid flow data for cataclastic fault rocks in porous sandstone from the 90-Fathom fault (northeast England). The study area represents a field analogue for North Sea saline aquifers of Permian–Triassic age that are currently being considered for CO2 storage. We use the experimental data to populate a synthetic model of a faulted saline aquifer to assess the impact of these fault rocks on CO2 injection. We show that even fault rocks with low clay contents and very limited quartz cementation can act as major baffles to the flow of a non-wetting phase if realistic two-phase properties are taken into account. Consequently, pressure may increase far more rapidly in the storage compartment during CO2 injection than anticipated based on models that only incorporate absolute fault rock permeabilities. To avoid high pressures, which may lead to hydrofracturing and CO2 leakage, either more complex injection strategies need to be adopted or seismic data acquired to ensure the absence of faults in aquifers selected for CO2 storage.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a viable runoff reduction mechanism and an important player in the hydrologic cycle of vegetated green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). As a dynamic process, ET is dependent on both meteorological factors (e.g., rainfall characteristics, relative humidity, and air temperature) and GSI properties (e.g., soil media type). This paper investigates the role of ET in runoff volume reduction of green roofs and rain gardens through a comprehensive literature review. Evapotranspiration is mostly unaccounted in the design and crediting of GSI systems because of the complex interaction of soil, plants, and climate that makes its quantification difficult. To improve vegetated GSI design for runoff volume reduction, design methods should consider ET and infiltration processes concurrently. Two methods, complex and simple, are reviewed and discussed herein. The simple method requires minimal input information compared to the more complex continuous simulation method; however continuous simulation yields volume reduction values more similar to field observations. It is demonstrated that modifying the drainage structure and using fine-grained in-situ soils can potentially increase ET in vegetated GSI systems. None of the available ET predictive equations, mostly derived from agricultural sciences, are found to precisely match observed GSI ET data. Until further research is conducted on GSI ET estimation methods, the 1985 Hargreaves method is recommended when performing continuous simulations. The 1985 Hargreaves method is simple, requires limited input data that are readily available, and generates reasonable results. Technical recommendations and directions for future research are provided.},

abstract = {Global land use patterns and increasing pressures on water resources demand creative urban stormwater management. Strategies encouraging infiltration can enhance groundwater recharge and water quality. Urban subsoils are often relatively impermeable, and the construction of many stormwater detention best management practices (D-BMPs) exacerbates this condition. Root paths can act as conduits for water, but this function has not been demonstrated for stormwater BMPs where standing water and dense subsoils create a unique environment. We examined whether tree roots can penetrate compacted subsoils and increase infiltration rates in the context of a novel infiltration BMP (I-BMP). Black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) trees, and an unplanted control, were installed in cylindrical planting sleeves surrounded by clay loam soil at two compaction levels (bulk density = 1.3 or 1.6 g cm(-3)) in irrigated containers. Roots of both species penetrated the more compacted soil, increasing infiltration rates by an average of 153{\%}. Similarly, green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) trees were grown in CUSoil (Amereq Corp., New York) separated from compacted clay loam subsoil (1.6 g cm(-3)) by a geotextile. A drain hole at mid depth in the CUSoil layer mimicked the overflow drain in a stormwater I-BMP thus allowing water to pool above the subsoil. Roots penetrated the geotextile and subsoil and increased average infiltration rate 27-fold compared to unplanted controls. Although high water tables may limit tree rooting depth, some species may be effective tools for increasing water infiltration and enhancing groundwater recharge in this and other I-BMPs (e.g., raingardens and bioswales).},

The state of Pennsylvania has older cities and towns, ample water resources, and water quality problems that are all connected by aging, existing infrastructure for stormwater management. As older cities and towns begin to invest in new infrastructure, they have two, relatively new technology options: first, green infrastructure, and second, "smart" infrastructure, which adds sensors, controls, and communications. This paper examines how officials from cities and water agencies perceive these two solutions for their current stormwater management problems. Semistructured interviews were conducted with officials from the five cities and towns throughout Pennsylvania that have enacted stormwater fees to fund further infrastructure investment. Responses indicate that the officials perceive green infrastructure as performing inconsistently across its lifecycle and requiring labor-intensive maintenance. These officials hold positive views about smart infrastructure but want more information on performance and costs to reduce runoff. This study suggests research and tools that would help these officials address their stormwater management problems.},

In the last 10 years, the way Reclamation uses risk information to manage dam safety across its inventory has developed gradually and steadily. Today, risk is used at the failure mode level to determine a course of action and at the facility level to determine the risk exposure. Risk is also used at the program level to assign resources, budget for studies and modifications, and justify potential structural modifications to Congress. Recently, Reclamation also began using risk to assess its own performance for the Office of Management and Budget. This paper will examine the various levels of detail and levels of effort used to accomplish Reclamation's objective of efficiently managing its inventory of dams and its resources. At each step, the available information, strategies, and decision-making processes will be explained.},

abstract = {Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since their initial definition. The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic TimeWarping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.},

abstract = {This research presents an initial study of the impacts of storm-water infiltration on a shallow unconfined aquifer at a bioinfiltration best management practice (BMP) on the campus of Villanova University. The study site is a vegetated infiltration basin with a 0.52 ha drainage area consisting of parking areas and recreational fields and features approximately 35{\%} directly connected impervious area. The research utilized continuous monitoring of precipitation, groundwater elevation, and groundwater temperature in conjunction with surface water hydrologic modeling to assess the duration, magnitude, and extent of groundwater mounding at a storm-water infiltration BMP. Results indicate that precipitation greater than 1.80 cm causes increased mounding at wells adjacent to the site. In addition, it was found that precipitation less than approximately 1.80 cm leads to larger increases in groundwater elevation at an upgradient control well located near the edge of a large grass field. The extent of groundwater mounding is observed to be localized to the BMP and does not extend a significant distance downgradient. In addition, the magnitude and duration of groundwater mounding is related to both infiltration rate and groundwater temperature, such that cooler temperatures correlate to increased mounding. This study demonstrates the utility of groundwater monitoring for the purpose of BMP hydraulic performance assessment, and recommends that additional research be conducted in the future and that groundwater monitoring be considered for site monitoring plans. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

Results indicated that impervious concrete surface exhibited a faster generation of runoff and with a runoff coefficient of 89{\%}. Grassland surface represented that time to runoff was about 25 times than that of the impervious surface and recorded the smallest runoff coefficient of 34 and 53{\%}. Compared with the impervious area, concave grassland was able to effectively delay time to runoff, while the porous pavement was able to significantly reduce runoff discharge and peak flow rate. A high rainfall intensity led to a reduction in time to runoff and an acceleration of runoff discharge and peak flow rate. Pervious surface under the lower side generated runoff at a slower rate, and registered a smaller runoff coefficient compared with the pervious surface under the upper side. The initial soil moisture and time to runoff had a significant negative correlation, and a positive correlation was found between the initial soil moisture and runoff coefficient. These findings facilitate a better understanding of runoff processes of urban surfaces and green infrastructures that may be able to help in better hydrology system design for mitigating urban flooding.},

abstract = {In humid and temperate regions, application of hydrologic models based on the Green and Ampt infiltration equation, during the spring season, often creates problem due to freezing and thawing of soils. These climatic conditions result in significant changes in hydrological and hydraulic properties of the soil. Three soil properties which are used to estimate parameters of the Green and Ampt infiltration equation were measured on repacked soil cores after subjecting them to a number of freeze-thaw cycles. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, air entry potential and total porosity tests were conducted to determine the influence of repeated freeze-thaw cycles on these properties and to incorporate the interactive effect of soil type, bulk density and saturation on these variables. The three soil types chosen for the experiment were silt loam, clay loam and loamy sand. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a steady upward flow constant head permeameter. The air-entry potential was estimated from the relationship between soil matric head and volumetric water content. Volumetric water content at saturation was used to approximate total porosity. Results from factorial analysis of variance indicate that the means of saturated hydraulic conductivity, total porosity and air-entry potential proved to be significantly different among soil types and bulk density. Changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity values for the three different soil types by the impact of continuous freeze-thaw cycles is most severe at lower degree of saturation and reduces in severity as the degree of saturation increases. {\textcopyright} 1999 Silsoe Research Institute.},

@article{Hannachi2007,
abstract = {Climate and weather constitute a typical example where high dimensional and complex phenomena meet. The atmospheric system is the result of highly complex interactions between many degrees of freedom or modes. In order to gain insight in understanding the dynamical/physical behaviour involved it is useful to attempt to understand their interactions in terms of a much smaller number of prominent modes of variability. This has led to the development by atmospheric researchers of methods that give a space display and a time display of large space-time atmospheric data. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were first used in meteorology in the late 1940s. The method, which decomposes a space-time field into spatial patterns and associated time indices, contributed much in advancing our knowledge of the atmosphere. However, since the atmosphere contains all sorts of features, e.g. stationary and propagating, EOFs are unable to provide a full picture. For example, EOFs tend, in general, to be difficult to interpret because of their geometric properties, such as their global feature, and their orthogonality in space and time. To obtain more localised features, modifications, e.g. rotated EOFs (REOFs), have been introduced. At the same time, because these methods cannot deal with propagating features, since they only use spatial correlation of the field, it was necessary to use both spatial and time information in order to identify such features. Extended and complex EOFs were introduced to serve that purpose. Because of the importance of EOFs and closely related methods in atmospheric science, and because the existing reviews of the subject are slightly out of date, there seems to be a need to update our knowledge by including new developments that could not be presented in previous reviews. This review proposes to achieve precisely this goal. The basic theory of the main types of EOFs is reviewed, and a wide range of applications using various data sets are also provided.

abstract = {Roads, highways, and developed land can alter hydrologic pathways, cause erosion and pollution to nearby waters. Best management practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce adverse effects of post-construction runoff (e.g., peak flows and runoff volumes). By applying the personal computer stormwater management model (PCSWMM), this study took an idealized catchment area approach to evaluate the performance of linear BMP alternatives for retaining the first inch of stormwater runoff from highways and roads in Illinois. Various combinations of BMPs consisting of vegetated filter strip, bioswale, and/or infiltration trench were analyzed. Two types of grass covers were considered: prairie grass and turf grass. One-inch of 24-h accumulated rainfall was used for all of evaluated scenarios. The sizes and dimensions of the evaluated BMPs were extracted from Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) projects. Stormwater runoff from combined post-BMP construction under the two different grass covers were compared to pre-BMP construction under the condition of bare soil cover. Results indicated that runoff reduction ranges from 96 to 99{\%} for combination of vegetated filter strip-bioswale, 89 to 100{\%} for vegetated filter strip-infiltration trench, and 100{\%} for bioswale-infiltration trench. Results also showed that prairie grass cover is more effective than turf grass in reducing runoff from various soil types. Findings from this study can benefit DOT to develop cost-effective solutions to manage storm runoff from roads and highways.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure practices are being implemented as a sustainable way to manage stormwater. Many communities are implementing green infrastructure practices on their own and in conjunction with gray infrastructure upgrades as an adaptation tool to mitigate risks and increase resilience in the face of climate change. Using a risk-based approach for design and planning has been common practice in flood control, but is not common in green infrastructure design. A risk-based approach for analyzing the performance of bioinfiltration practices was developed to assist in design and evaluation of performance over time. Bioinfiltration practices are vegetated basins that capture and retain runoff through infiltration and evapotranspiration without the use of an underdrain. Bioinfiltration facilities with varied ponding depths, media depths, and native soil saturated hydraulic conductivity based on regional design guidelines, and a field-calibrated site, were modeled over a 30-year period and compared to a predevelopment condition as the target design performance, which defined the acceptable risk. In this analysis, risk was determined for each bioinfiltration design based on the product of the probability of a rainfall event occurring, the probability of an overflow event occurring, and the average volume of overflow; the terms used to define risk can be modified to reflect local priorities. Cumulative annual risk for bioinfiltration designs was compared to acceptable risk to determine appropriate design. Results indicated that designs with increased ponding depth decreased cumulative risk. Designs with higher native soil hydraulic conductivity had reduced risk when compared to a predevelopment scenario and observed in the field-calibrated bioinfiltration site. The risk-based approach provides a helpful tool for municipal separate storm sewer system communities and combined sewer communities for design and evaluation of bioinfiltration practices.},

abstract = {Construction and maintenance can have major implications on the long-term functioning of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) facilities. The GSI facilities investigated were bioretention, permeable pavement, sand filters, infiltration trenches, and vegetated swales. This study first highlights the most important construction and maintenance items based on relevant studies and state stormwater manuals from the United States. Fairfax County, Virginia, was used as a case study to evaluate the County's current stormwater program and illuminate common maintenance issues found for each GSI type. The data analysis showed that deficiencies found can vary between public and private facilities, depending most likely on site conditions and frequency of routine maintenance. Sediment accumulation was found to be the most common maintenance issue (27.8{\%} of inspections), supporting the importance of adequate pretreatment and good housekeeping when implementing GSI. Current postconstruction inspections performed by the County were found to be failing to detect inadequacies in bioretention facilities due to improper construction. It is recommended that municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) thoroughly record and track construction and postconstruction inspection items to improve the longevity of its facilities and better inform future decision making regarding GSI.},

Combining reductions in runoff volume and pollutant concentrations, green infrastructure has been successfully introduced into separate and combined sewer areas to decrease stormwater pollution and combined sewer overflows. Because green infrastructure uses vegetation, soil, and other innovative materials, these water quality benefits are complemented by additional environmental benefits including improved air quality, reduced urban temperatures, energy savings, aesthetic improvements, and a potential strategy for reducing carbon footprints. The ability of green infrastructure to provide multiple environmental benefits allows municipalities to use limited economic resources more efficiently and provides a framework for sustainable infrastructure management.},

abstract = {Infiltration Best Management Practices (BMPs) are becoming more readily acceptable as a means of reducing postdevelopment runoff volumes and peak flow rates to pre-construction levels, while simultaneously increasing recharge. However, the design, construction, and operation of infiltration basins to this point have not been standardized due to a lack of understanding of the infiltration processes that occur in these structures. Sizing infiltration BMPs to hold and store a predetermined volume of runoff, typically called the Water Quality Volume, has become a widely accepted practice. This method of sizing BMPs does not account for the infiltration that is occurring in the BMP during the storm event; which could result in significantly oversized BMPs. The objective of this study was to develop a methodology to simulate varying infiltration rates observed from a large scale rock infiltration basin BMP. The results should aid in improved design of such structures. This methodology is required to predict the performance of these sites using single event and continuous flow models. The study site is a Pervious Concrete Infiltration Basin BMP built in 2002 in a common area at Villanova University. The system consists of three infiltration beds filled with coarse aggregate, lined with geotextile filter fabric, overlain with pervious concrete and underlain by undisturbed silty sand. The BMP is extensively instrumented to facilitate water quantity and quality research. The infiltration performance of the site is the focus of the study. Recorded data indicates a wide variation of linear infiltration rates for smaller storm events. A model was developed using the Green-Ampt formula to characterize the infiltration occurring in the basin for small storm events characterized by an accumulated depth of water in the infiltration bed of less than 10 cm. The effectiveness and accuracy of the model were measured by comparing the model outputs with observed bed water elevation data recorded from instrumentation on site. Results show that for bed depths of {\textless}10 cm, hydraulic conductivity is the most sensitive parameter, and that the storm event measured infiltration rate is substantially less then the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The governing factor affecting hydraulic conductivity, and subsequently, infiltration rate is temperature; with higher rates occurring during warmer periods, affecting the infiltration rate by as much as 56{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

Various designs have been tested including those that rely on underdrains, have internal water storage (IWS) layers, or are underdrain-free. The cells provide a range of watershed practice size ratios and employ a variety of land covers. Researchers are pooling water quantity and quality data to help create new design standards. Initial results from the shared data will be presented, with specific attention to bioretention design parameters that control flow modification and water quality improvement. Two bioretention cells of varying vegetative cover are being monitored in Rocky Mount, NC. This site is located in the upper coastal plain with sandy in-situ soils. These cells were designed with a 0.9 m media depth and a 0.6 m deep internal water storage (IWS) layer. Another bioretention cell is being monitored in Silver Spring, MD. It was constructed with a 0.9 m media depth and a 0.3 m pooling depth. Finally, there are two bioinfiltration cells being monitored in Villanova, PA. The first is the "Traffic Island" bioinfiltration cell, which has been monitored since 2003. The bowl is only designed for 1.2 cm over the impervious surface, yet overflow rarely occurs for events less than 5.1 cm. The site had groundwater wells installed in 2007 and is the subject of an ongoing study on the groundwater effects. The second site has only been monitored for approximately six months. Cumulatively, the four bioretention cells extensively examined have dramatically reduced outflow volumes, completely assimilating all events less than 1.2 cm - and in some designs much greater events. By aggregating the data, runoff reduction by bioretention can be profound. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

The biggest problems in time series data are consecutively missing values that would result in serious information loss if simply dropped from the dataset. To address this problem, we adapt the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in a novel way for multivariate time series imputation. The algorithm employs Dynamic Time Warping as distance metric instead of point-wise distance measurements. We preprocess the data with linear interpolation to create complete windows for Dynamic Time Warping. The algorithm derives global distance weights from the correlation between features and consecutively missing values are penalized by individual distance weights to reduce error transfer from linear interpolation. Finally, efficient ensemble methods improve the accuracy. Experimental results show accurate imputations on datasets with a high correlation between features. Further, our algorithm shows better results with consecutively missing values than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

One of these precipitates corresponded to a lipoprotein species dominated by apoprotein A-II (apo A-II). Zonal ultracentrifugation of cholestatic plasma showed a decrease of HDL and a disappearance of the normal delineation of HDL2 and HDL3. In addition a new component designated HDL1-C was observed. Consistent results were found at studies of the molecular size distribution of cholestatic HDL by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The lipid and apoprotein composition of isolated cholestatic HDL fractions differed considerably from normal. Most notable were the high proportions of phospholipids and free cholesterol and the occurrence of the apoprotein E (arginine-rich protein) in remarkably high amounts especially in the abnormal HDL1-C.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers. Popularity of infiltration-based green infrastructure (GI) has spurred concern about rising groundwater tables and the potential detrimental effect on building foundations. This study examines water table fluctuations adjacent to green infrastructure sidewalk planters during two winters (2014-2015 and 2016-2017) in Philadelphia. Groundwater mounding is observed in the latter period but not the former. Due to the proximity to a park, the water table rise is the combined effect from both the GI and the park. For the first winter, the sidewalk planters were not fully vegetated or maintained. It is hypothesized that the increased groundwater mounding in 2016-2017 was from the increased infiltration rate caused by improved vegetation and maintenance. Groundwater mounding was not observed beyond 3 m from the GI except for large storms. Because the water table rise was transient, groundwater mounding had minimal impact beyond 3 m for current GI configurations and soil conditions. The observations conform to prior computer simulations. The results also show that intraseason water table fluctuations are far greater than those created by local infiltration.},

abstract = {Green walls are becoming a popular infrastructure choice in densely built urban environments, due to their multiple benefits. However, high and vastly variable water requirements of these systems are preventing their further widespread. Only a small number of studies have investigated water needs of green walls, even though this can help to design more optimal systems with increased benefits. Additionally, the knowledge on interactions between plant uptake and climate conditions (temperature and humidity) is lacking. The aim of this study was to understand daily water requirements of five plant species (C. appressa, N. obliterata, L. muscari, M. parvifolium and O. japonicus) used in greywater treating green walls, across different seasons, temperature, and humidity conditions of temperate-oceanic climate (common in parts of Australia, US and Europe). The results showed that during summer, dominant water uptake processes were plant uptake and transpiration, resulting in three to four times higher water needs than during winter, when evaporation is a major effect. Top levels of the multi-level green wall exhibited significantly higher plant activity compared to bottom levels, showing four times greater water uptake. Temperature and humidity changes during winter caused the change in water uptake of plants, pointing to different growing and activity patterns of tested plants. During summer only N. obliterata showed temperature and humidity dependence. Annual plant water uptake and other practical recommendations are given based on the results. Even though this study focused on water requirements of greywater treating green walls, its findings can also inform traditional green wall designs.},

The methodology and suitability of each test type are explained through real world examples of each. Quantitative SRT data are also used to calibrate a model that predicts infiltration rates and helps calculate water budgets. Data analysis infrastructure is discussed. Philadelphia Water's GSI monitoring group uses R (R core team, 2015) and related technologies for automated quality assurance and quality control of large amounts of CWL data. The R infrastructure allows for ease of visualization, report writing, and malfunction detection. Interoperation with a sophisticated R-based analysis tool called PilotDB allows for tracking performance and compliance in a cloud-based dashboard.

abstract = {We present a method for identifying features (time periods of interest) in data sets consisting of time-indexed model output. The method is used as a diagnostic to quickly focus the attention on a subset of the data before further analysis methods are applied. Mathematically, the infinity norm errors of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) reconstructions are calculated for each time output. The result is an EOF reconstruction error map which clearly identifies features as changes in the error structure over time. The ubiquity of EOF-type methods in a wide range of disciplines reduces barriers to comprehension and implementation of the method. We apply the error map method to three different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data sets as examples: the development of a spontaneous instability in a large amplitude internal solitary wave, an internal wave interacting with a density profile change, and the collision of two waves of different vertical mode. In all cases the EOF error map method identifies relevant features which are worthy of further study.},

abstract = {— We consider various cases of seismicity, induced by artificial fluid injections in boreholes. Like many other authors, we support the hypothesis that to a large extent the triggering of this seismicity is caused by a diffusive process of the pore pressure relaxation in porous (or fractured), saturated rocks. We show that if this hypothesis is correct, then the spatio-temporal distributions of the seismic events must have several specific features related to the effective permeability of the rock. As a rule the fluid injection-induced seismicity obeys such features. These features can be indications of the diffusive and even hydraulic nature of the seismicity triggering process.{\P}From this point of view we analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of the late aftershocks of the Antofagasta (northern Chile) 1995 earthquake. These aftershocks were concentrated in a plane, an approximately 3 km-thick spatial zone. This thin seismogenic layer is a part of the South American subduction zone. The time-distance distribution of the aftershocks along this layer indicates that they could be triggered by a diffusion-like process. Possibly, such a process is the relaxation of the pressure perturbation caused in the pore fluid by the main Antofagasta event. We estimated the permeability required to explain the spatio-temporal distribution of the aftershocks by such a triggering mechanism. The obtained value, 60 mD, is very large. However, it is realistic for a long-time existing and large-scale fault zone.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {The storage potential of subsurface geological systems makes them viable candidates for long-term disposal of significant quantities of CO2. The geo-mechanical responses of these systems as a result of injection processes as well as the protracted storage of CO2 are aspects that require sufficient understanding. A hypothetical model has been developed that conceptualises a typical well-reservoir system comprising an injection well where the fluid (CO2) is introduced and a production/abandoned well sited at a distant location. This was accomplished by adopting a numerical methodology (discrete element method), specifically designed to investigate the geo-mechanical phenomena whereby the various processes are monitored at the inter-particle scale. Fracturing events were simulated. In addition, the influence of certain operating variables such as injection flow rate and fluid pressure was studied with particular interest in the nature of occurring fractures and trend of propagation, the pattern and magnitude of pressure build-up at the well vicinity, pressure distribution between well regions and pore velocity distribution between well regions. Modelling results generally show an initiation of fracturing caused by tensile failure of the rock material at the region of fluid injection; however, fracturing caused by shear failure becomes more dominant at the later stage of injection. Furthermore, isolated fracturing events were observed to occur at the production/abandoned wells that were not propagated from the injection point. This highlights the potential of CO2 introduced through an injection well, which could be used to enhance oil/gas recovery at a distant production well. The rate and magnitude of fracture development are directly influenced by the fluid injection rate. Likewise, the magnitude of pressure build-up is greatly affected by the fluid injection rate and the distance from the point of injection. The DEM modelling technique illustrated provides an effective procedure that allows for more specific investigations of geo-mechanical mechanisms occurring at subsurface systems. The application of this methodology to the injection and storage of CO2 facilitates the understanding of the fracturing phenomenon as well as the various factors governing the process.},

The effects of GSI system geometry were assessed by evaluating the area available for infiltration and pressure head dependency of infiltration. Two common GSI types with different geometries, a bioinfiltration rain garden and an infiltration trench, were continuously simulated using the storage unit (SU) object and low impact development (LID) module in the USEPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The models were calibrated and validated using three years of observed data. The results suggest that the stored water depth in GSI systems has a substantial effect on infiltration in narrow, vertical-walled infiltration trenches, while soil moisture conditions play a relatively more important role for infiltration in shallow rain gardens with gradually sloping walls. As such, when modeling the effect of water depth and soil moisture, the SU object was found to simulate the infiltration trench better than the LID module, while the LID module worked better for the rain garden.},

These highly degraded infrastructures are already overwhelmed and continued to impose a significant challenge to the quality of water and ecological systems. With predicted urban growth and climate change the situation is only going to get worse. As a result, municipalities are increasingly considering the concept of retrofitting existing stormwater drainage systems with green infrastructure practices as the first and an important step to reduce stormwater runoff volume and pollutant load inputs into combined sewer systems (CSO) and wastewater facilities. Green infrastructure practices include an open green space that can absorb stormwater runoff, ranging from small-scale naturally existing pocket of lands, right-of-way bioswales, and trees planted along the sidewalk as well as large-scale public parks. Despite the growing municipalities' interest to retrofit existing stormwater drainage systems with green infrastructure, few studies and relevant information are available on their performance and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, this paper aims to help professionals learn about and become familiar with green infrastructure, decrease implementation barriers, and provide guidance for monitoring green infrastructure using the combination of survey questionnaires, meta-narrative and systematic literature review techniques.},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that well-designed bioretention cells are often not adequately installed and that maintenance is lacking, leading to less-than-adequate water storage volume and/or surface infiltration rates post-construction. In March 2009, two sets of bioretention cells were repaired by excavating the top 75 mm of fill media, increasing the bioretention surface storage volume by nearly 90{\%} and the infiltration rate by up to a factor of 10. Overflow volume decreased from 35 and 37{\%} in the pre-repair state for two different sets of cells, respectively, to 11 and 12{\%}. Nearly all effluent pollutant loads exiting the post-repair cells were lower than their pre-repair conditions. The bioretention systems employed two different media depths (0.6 and 0.9 m). The deeper media cells discharged less outflow volume than the shallower cells, with 10-11{\%} more runoff volume leaving as exfiltration from the 0.9-m than from the 0.6-m media depth cells. This study showed that maintenance is both critical and beneficial to restore otherwise poorly performing bioretention. Moreover, while deeper media cells did outperform the shallower systems, the improvement in this case was somewhat modest vis-{\`{a}}-vis additional construction costs. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2012.},

abstract = {Inference about time series in weather data can be made in several ways. Current practice focuses on computing summary measures, such as mean and variance, or constructing a reference year from small subsets of data derived from multiple years. Some applications require the selection of an instance of observed data over a fixed time frame, typically a year or more, for modeling. In addition, many current methods do not include rainfall as a parameter of interest. This paper reviews and refines existing methods for determining a reference year by creating a metric that measures the (abstract) distance between observed patterns of rainfall. The reference year is then chosen from a group of potential reference years. This method is computationally efficient, easily explained, and robust against differences in the index of reporting, to include leap years. Application of the distance metric to data from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk, Virginia, shows that it appropriately identifies not only the years that are most typical for a location, but extreme years as well. Both are particularly useful in applications related to urban hydrology, which formed the basis for development of this method. Results also demonstrate that the proposed method is functionally different than existing methods. The distance metric represents an evolutionary step forward, overcomes some difficulties present from other approaches, and would be applicable to a number of cross-disciplinary applications.},

abstract = {The distribution of rainfall has major impacts in agriculture, affecting the soil, hydrology, and plant health in agricultural systems. The goal of this study was to test for recent changes in rainfall intensity and seasonal rainfall variability in the Southeastern U.S. by exploring the data collaboratively with agricultural stakeholders. Daily rainfall records from the Global Historical Climatology Network were used to analyze changes in rain intensity and seasonal rainfall variability. During the last 30. years (1985-2014), there has been a significant change (53{\%} increase) in the number of extreme rainfall days ({\textgreater}152.4 mm/day) and there have been significant decreases in the number of moderate intensity (12.7-25.4 mm/day) and heavy (25.4-76.2 mm/day) rainfall days in the Southeastern U.S., when compared to the previous 30-year period (1955-1984). There have also been significant decreases in the return period of months in which greater than half of the monthly total rain occurred in a single day; this is an original, stakeholder-developed rainfall intensity metric. The variability in spring and summer rainfall increased during the last 30 years, but winter and fall showed less variability in seasonal totals in the last 30 years. In agricultural systems, rainfall is one of the leading factors affecting yield variability; so it can be expected that more variable rainfall and more intense rain events could bring new challenges to agricultural production. However, these changes can also present opportunities for producers who are taking measures to adjust management strategies to make their systems more resilient to increased rain intensity and variability.},

abstract = {Urban stormwater runoff is a growing contributor to the impairment of surface waters. Nature-based technologies, including green roofs, vegetated swales, grassed filter strips, bioretention, and pervious pavements have been demonstrated to be effective in mitigating detrimental runoff characteristics. Lacking, however, has been a fundamental engineering analysis approach to these technologies. Current design guidance is based on empirical recommendations and most performance data are based on limited, localized observations. Flow balances, including infiltration, evapotranspiration and surface discharge, based on fundamental fluid dynamics principles can be employed through analysis to understand flow management. Water quality improvements will occur through a specific unit processes or mechanisms, including sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, biotransformation, bio-uptake, and heat transfer. The performance of a specific technology will depend on the facility configuration and makeup, climate, surrounding soil characteristics, topography, and the site hydrology. Applying fundamental flow and water quality processes to storm water management technologies will allow quantitative design and predictable performance characterization.},

abstract = {Equations that relate drainage area to bankfull discharge and channel characteristics (such as width, depth, and cross-sectional area) at gaged sites are needed to help define bankfull discharge and channel characteristics at ungaged sites and can be used in stream-restoration and protection projects, stream-channel classification, and channel assessments. These equations are intended to serve as a guide for streams in areas of similar hydrologic, climatic, and physiographic conditions. New York State contains eight hydrologic regions that were previously delineated on the basis of high-flow (flood) characteristics. This report seeks to increase understanding of the factors affecting bankfull discharge and channel characteristics to drainage-area size relations in New York State by providing an in-depth analysis of seven previously published regional bankfull-discharge and channel-characteristics curves. Stream-survey data and discharge records from 281 cross sections at 82 streamflow-gaging stations were used in regression analyses to relate drainage area to bankfull discharge and bankfull-channel width, depth, and cross-sectional area. The R2 and standard errors of estimate of each regional equation were compared to the R2 and standard errors of estimate for the statewide (pooled) model to determine if regionalizing data reduced model variability. It was found that regional models typically yield less variable results than those obtained using pooled statewide equations, which indicates statistically significant regional differences in bankfull-discharge and channel-characteristics relations. All but two of the bankfull-discharge curves are within the 95-percent confidence interval bands of the statewide model; all the models have statistically similar slopes, and only one model has a unique intercept. Regional variations in channel-characteristics models of bankfull width, depth, and cross-sectional area were more prevalent than for bankfull discharge, though the magnitude of the differences varied. It was hypothesized that some regional variability could be reduced by creating models for streams with similar physiographic and climatic characteristics. Available data on streamflow patterns and previous regional-curve research suggested that mean annual runoff, Rosgen stream type, and slope were the variables most likely to influence regional bankfull discharge and channel characteristics to drainage-area size relations. Results showed that although all of these factors had an influence on regional relations, most stratified models have lower R2 values and higher standard errors of estimate than the regional models. The New York statewide (pooled) bankfull-discharge equation and equations for regions 4 and 7 were compared with equations for four other regions in the Northeast to evaluate region-to-region differences, and assess the ability of individual curves to produce results more accurate than those that would be obtained from one model of the northeastern United States. Results indicated that model slopes lack significant differences, though intercepts are significantly different. Comparison of bankfull-discharge estimates using different models shows that results could vary by as much as 100 percent depending on which model was used and indicated that regionalization improved model accuracy.},

abstract = {The transportation and urban infrastructure relies heavily on impervious surfaces. Unmitigated rainfall runoff from impervious surfaces can lead to a myriad of environmental problems in downgradient areas. To address this issue, novel stormwater control measures (SCMs) are being emphasized and implemented widely to mitigate some of the impacts of impervious surface. Bioretention is a soil/media-based SCM that is often used for this purpose, but current design practices are highly empirical. This study compiles work from three research sites in three states to provide some fundamental underpinnings to bioretention design. Although all sites demonstrate different levels of performance, water volumetric performance trends are common to all. These trends are based on the available storage in the bioretention cell, termed herein as the Bioretention Abstraction Volume (BAV). The BAV is directly related to available media porosity and storage in the surface bowl. A finite capacity to completely store all runoff from smaller events is defined by the BAV. Normalization for this storage provides prediction for volumetric performance. Recommendations for bioretention design are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Storm water control measures SCMs, also known as best management practices BMPs, such as rain gardens, are designed to infiltrate storm-water runoff and reduce pollutant transport to surface waters. The life span of these SCMs may be limited depending on the composition of sediments in runoff water. Settling of fine sediments may clog soil pore spaces, reducing the infiltration capacity of the soil and reducing the potential benefits of this SCM. A study was conducted on a Villanova campus rain garden that accepts runoff from an adjacent parking lot to determine if there was a relationship between the accumulation of fine sediments over time and the infiltration capacity. The soil textural profile within the rain garden was characterized prior to SCM installation 2001, after installation, after five years, and after seven years of receiving storm-water runoff. Infiltration data were collected by the single-ring infiltrometer method in 2006 and 2009. Differences in soil texture were found between locations within the infiltration basin, and accumulation of fines smaller than 0.1 mm was observed at both locations sampled in 2009. Infiltration rates were significantly different between the two locations measured within the rain garden, but infiltration rates did not change significantly over time within those regions. This SCM was designed at a 10:1 watershed to SCM area ratio, which is twice what is recommended by the PA DEP BMP Manual. The data collected over the seven years since installation indicate that while fines have accumulated in the SCM there has been no significant change in infiltration potential.},

abstract = {Since unsaturated soil conditions are normally experienced above the groundwater table, most treated or stabilised soils for roadworks, earth dams' embankments, landfill sites, hydraulic barriers etc. could be regarded as existing in this region. The soil–water characteristic (or retention) curve (SWCC) is a useful conceptual tool by which an evaluation of unsaturated soil's property functions and corresponding macro-scale behaviour (strength, volume change, hydraulic conductivity, fluid flow, diffusivity, etc.) can be carried out. Hence, an examination of some of the various factors that could affect the hydraulic or water retention property of the stabilised soil is very vital both for laboratory studies and field practice. However, a thorough assessment of the water retention behaviour of stabilised soils can be understandably limited sometimes. This could be partly due to some of the perculiar conditions associated with soil preparation methods, soil type, soil-stabiliser mix proportion used, curing conditions, method of compaction, durability assessment modalities and other logistical issues surrounding either laboratory instrumentation or in-situ application. This article presents a critical and comprehensive review of these factors on the stabilised soil's water retention behaviour and also provides a systematic understanding of the mechanisms of stabilisation occurring at the micro- and macro-mechanical levels. Recommendations are also made to stimulate further discussions on the synthesis of SWCC of stabilised soils vis-{\`{a}}-vis factors influencing them with possible interpreted engineering behaviours such as shear strength and soil consolidation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. A core concept in stormwater green infrastructure (GI) design is whether a system will meet its rainfall-runoff volume capture goals within a period of time after a previous event. In GI design, it is necessary not to view storms as singular, isolated events, but rather as a series of events, some of which are occurring within short durations and are often termed back-to-back events. This paper demonstrates the statistical rarity of back-to-back rainfall events that impact GI performance and analyzes the expected impact on the design of several GI systems for the mid-Atlantic region. Twenty-four scenarios were evaluated for common design events (2.5, 3.8, and 8.1 cm), followed by a substantial subsequent event (50-100{\%} of the original storm volume) that occurred within the period where it would be expected that the GI system would be recovering capacity (24, 48, 72, or 96 h interevent period). The results indicated that only four scenarios had an annual average occurrence greater than one time per year, and 9 of the 24 scenarios had less than 0.1 annual average occurrences. Simple, conservative models of a bioinfiltration rain garden and green roof demonstrated that system storage capacity is almost always restored by infiltration and evapotranspiration within the prescribed interevent drawdown period, thus back-to-back events are not a primary concern. This finding was further confirmed with field site evidence from three GI sites at Villanova University, which regularly captured more than the design rainfall volume and only infrequently had minimal discharges for rainfalls smaller than design. An exception to this finding was that a green roof with a drainage layer did not exceed its design capacity because the drainage layer conveyed stored water away from the GI system before evapotranspiration could contribute to volume removal. These results demonstrate that the likelihood of large back-to-back events is very low, as is the chance of the design runoff volume being exceeded. This paper provides evidence that the existing required drawdown period for GI design can be overly restrictive for a system to meet its volume control goals, which may inhibit optimal implementation. The findings support more appropriate design through the development of regionally specific required drawdown times based on storm event frequency.},

Ein Schnellverfahren zur Messung der Wasserleitf{\"{a}}higkeit im teilges{\"{a}}ttigten Boden an Stechzylinderproben. Arch. Acker- u. Pflanzenbau u. Bodenkd. Berlin 24, 1-7], the weight of a soil sample and pressure heads at two height levels are recorded at consecutive times. The evaluation of these measurements relies on linearization assumptions with respect to time, space and the water content-pressure head relationship. In this article, we investigate the errors that result from the linearization assumptions, and show how systematic and stochastic measurement errors affect the calculation of water retention and hydraulic conductivity data and the resulting fits of soil hydraulic functions. We find that linearization errors with respect to time are negligible if cubic Hermite splines are used for data interpolation. Linearizations in space lead to minor errors, even in the late stage of evaporation where strongly non-linear pressure head profiles emerge. A bias in the estimated retention function results from the negligence of a non-linear water content distribution in the sample at the begin of the evaporation process, and affects primarily coarse sands or soils with structured pore systems. This error can be avoided if an integral evaluation of the measurements is used. We introduce an applicable rejection criterion for unreliable hydraulic conductivity data near saturation, based on the error in the hydraulic gradient. Calibration errors of tensiometers lead to biased estimates of hydraulic properties in the wet range, whereas errors in tensiometer installation positions yield biases in the dry range. Random errors in data cause no significant bias, and parametric hydraulic functions can be estimated with small uncertainties, if water retention and conductivity functions are coupled and the underlying model structure is correct. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous works have attempted to define the relationship between performance and wetland design variables (e.g., length, width, area). However, these works suffer from two major flaws: small sample size and/or nonrandom samples. The authors provide a framework herein to overcome these flaws. The goals of this research were to develop a methodology for creating randomly generated wetlanddesigns and to use these designs to develop a set of equations for predicting peak flow reduction. Two thousand randomly generated wetland designs were generated using a five-tiered approach. Channel length and roughness were highly correlated with peak flow reduction and explained 83{\%} of the total variability within the data set. Because of the large number of randomly generated designs, the regression equations presented herein prevent bias toward nonrandom designs. These equations represent the most general predictive performance equations developed to date and can be used to aid in CSW design. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Many types of structural stormwater best management practice (BMP) have been employed since the late 1990s in the hope of mitigating the impervious surface hydrology (indicated by, e.g., high runoff volume and peak flow rates, sewer and ditch runoff conveyance, and short time to peak flow) and deteriorating water quality due to land development and human activities. It is time to examine the status of the BMP deployment from an infrastructure perspective and reflect the best strategies for low-impact development (LID). This paper presents a 22-month field investigation for 279 structural BMPs and 227 major outfalls (defined as storm drain outfall pipes with an equivalent diameter of 91 cm or larger) along highways in Prince George's County, Maryland, an area that has LID BMP research and employment history for decades. This study offers a snapshot about the state and effectiveness of structural BMPs in mitigating highway runoff in this region. The results indicate that the majority of structural BMPs deployed along the regional highway system are infiltration trenches and stormwater ponds, both of which need extensive maintenance. Due to safety concerns for traveling vehicles, fast runoff conveyance and end-of-pipe treatment are sometimes required in highway systems, prompting challenges for the LID designs. Stormwater discharged from 51{\%} of the major outfalls is not treated, indicating strong demands for stormwater green infrastructure expansion and retrofit. This paper identifies general problems and maintenance needs of different highway structural BMP designs as well as providing recommendations for improvement to engineers and highway administrators.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides well-established tools for the prediction of the velocity profiles in turbulent pipe flows. As far as industrial pipe and district heating systems are concerned, combinations of elbows are the most common pipe assemblies. Among the different pipe combinations, double elbows out-of-plane are of special interest, since they introduce strong disturbances into the flow profile and have a strong influence on many common types of flow meters. In front of a double elbow there is often another flow-disturbing installation. As a result the upstream conditions are unknown and an investigation of the resulting systematic bias on the measurement of the flow rate and the associated contribution to its measurement uncertainty is necessary. We demonstrate here that this can be achieved by a variation of the inlet profile in terms of swirls and asymmetry components. In particular, an ultrasonic and an electromagnetic flow meter are modeled in order to quantify the systematic errors stemming from uncertain inflow conditions. For this purpose, a generalized non-intrusive polynomial chaos method has been used in conjunction with a commercial CFD code. As the most influential parameters on the measured volume flow, the distance between the double elbow and the flow meter as well as the orientation of the flow meter are considered as random variables in the polynomial chaos approach. This approach allowed us to obtain accurate prediction of the systematic error for the ultrasonic and electromagnetic meter as functions of the distance to the double elbow. The resulting bias in the flow rate has been found to be in the range of 1.5–4.5{\%} (0.1–0.5{\%}) with a systematic uncertainty contribution of 2–2.4{\%} (0.6–0.7{\%}) for the ultrasonic (electromagnetic) flow meter if the distance to the double elbow is smaller than 40 pipe diameters. Moreover, it is demonstrated that placing the flow meters in a Venturi constriction leads to substantial decrease of the bias and the contribution to the measurement uncertainty stemming from the uncertain inflow condition.},

abstract = {Rainfall runoff models are frequently used for design processes for urban infrastructure. The most sensitive input for these models is precipitation data. Therefore, it is crucial to account for temporal and spatial variability of rainfall events as accurately as possible to avoid misleading simulation results. This paper aims to show the significant errors that can occur by using rainfall measurement resolutions in urban environments that are too coarse. We analyzed the spatial variability of rainfall events from two years with the validated data of 22 rain gauges spread out over an urban catchment of 125 km2. By looking at the interstation correlation of the rain gauges for different classes of rainfall intensities, we found that rainfall events with low and intermediate intensities show a good interstation correlation. However, the correlation drops significantly for heavy rainfall events suggesting higher spatial variability for more intense rainstorms. Further, we analyzed the possible deviation from the spatial rainfall interpolation that uses all available rain gauges when reducing the number of rain gauges to interpolate the spatial rainfall for 24 chosen events. With these analyses we found that reducing the available information by half results in deviations of up to 25{\%} for events with return periods shorter than one year and 45{\%} for events with longer return periods. Assuming uniformly distributed rainfall over the entire catchment resulted in deviations of up to 75{\%} and 125{\%}, respectively. These findings are supported by the work of past research projects and underline the necessity of a high spatial measurement density in order to account for spatial variability of intense rainstorms.},

abstract = {Environmental observations are fundamental to hydrology and water resources, and the way these data are organized and manipulated either enables or inhibits the analyses that can be performed. The Observations Data Model presented here provides a new and consistent format for the storage and retrieval of point environmental observations in a relational database designed to facilitate integrated analysis of large data sets collected by multiple investigators. Within this data model, observations are stored with sufficient ancillary information (metadata) about the observations to allow them to be unambiguously interpreted and to provide traceable heritage from raw measurements to useable information. The design is based upon a relational database model that exposes each single observation as a record, taking advantage of the capability in relational database systems for querying based upon data values and enabling cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis. This paper presents the design principles and features of the Observations Data Model and illustrates how it can be used to enhance the organization, publication, and analysis of point observations data while retaining a simple relational format. The contribution of the data model to water resources is that it represents a new, systematic way to organize and share data that overcomes many of the syntactic and semantic differences between heterogeneous data sets, thereby facilitating an integrated understanding of water resources based on more extensive and fully specified information.

@article{Booth1997,
abstract = {Urbanization of a watershed degrades both the form and the function of the downstream aquatic system, causing changes that can occur rapidly and are very difficult to avoid or correct. A variety of physical data from lowland streams in western Washington displays the onset of readily observable aquatic-system degradation at a remarkably consistent level of development, typically about ten percent effective impervious area in a watershed. Even lower levels of urban development cause significant degradation in sensitive water bodies and a reduced, but less well quantified, level of function throughout the system as a whole. Unfortunately, established methods of mitigating the downstream impacts of urban development may have only limited effectiveness. Using continuous hydrologic modeling we have evaluated detention ponds designed by conventional event methodologies, and our findings demonstrate serious deficiencies in actual pond performance when compared to their design goals. Even with best efforts at mitigation, the sheer magnitude of development activities falling below a level of regulatory concern suggests that increased resource loss will invariably accompany development of a watershed. Without a better understanding of the critical processes that lead to degradation, some downstream aquatic-system damage is probably inevitable without limiting the extent of watershed development itself.},

In this research, a unique type of Sharp-Crested V-notch weir, entitled SCVW, has been introduced. The hydraulic characteristics of the present weir were investigated theoretically and experimentally under free aerated and non-aerated flow conditions in an open channel for large physical models. To investigate the variations of the discharge coefficient of SCVW versus weir height and vertex angle, a comprehensive laboratory experiments were conducted by measuring the discharge and the water head over the crest of weir. Possibility of different formulations for the head- discharge relationship of SCVW was examined and suitable analytical equation was proposed. The computed discharge using the suggested equation was within 0–10{\%} of the observed ones. According to the experimental observations, the SCVW showed better performance in comparison with normal wire.},

abstract = {Bioretention, or variations such as bioinfiltration and rain gardens, has become one of the most frequently used storm-water management tools in urbanized watersheds. Incorporating both filtration and infiltration, initial research into bioretention has shown that these facilities substantially reduce runoff volumes and peak flows. Low impact development, which has a goal of modifying postdevelopment hydrology to more closely mimic that of predevelopment, is a driver for the use of bioretention in many parts of the country. Research over the past decade has shown that bioretention effluent loads are low for suspended solids, nutrients, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. Pollutant removal mechanisms include filtration, adsorption, and possibly biological treatment. Limited research suggests that bioretention can effectively manage other pollutants, such as pathogenic bacteria and thermal pollution, as well. Reductions in pollutant load result from the combination of concentration reduction and runoff volume attenuation, linking water quality and hydrologic performance. Nonetheless, many design questions persist for this practice, such as maximum pooling bowl depth, minimum fill media depth, fill media composition and configuration, underdrain configuration, pretreatment options, and vegetation selection. Moreover, the exact nature and impact of bioretention maintenance is still evolving, which will dictate long-term performance and life-cycle costs. Bioretention usage will grow as design guidance matures as a result of continued research and application. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) can capture stormwater onsite for volume reduction and peak flow attenuation in combined sewers. A pilot study in St. Louis evaluated how the use of rain garden and planter box to collect and mitigate stormwater runoff from roof drain can benefit the volume reduction of the flows in combined sewers. The study included two sites: a test site where GI (i.e. rain gardens and planter boxes) was installed; and a control site where no GI was installed. Flow and rainfall data were collected for a period of one and half year. Because many factors can affect the measured flow data from combined sewers, different methods for analyzing the same set of data could lead to difference in reported effectiveness of GI performance. This paper reports a study that examined two treatment methods of the flow monitoring data and the resulting effectiveness of GI performance for volume reduction. One treatment of the data considered flow data from same 24-hour periods between the test and control sites for evaluating GI?s performance. A second treatment of the data analyzed all of acceptable flow data collected from the test and control sites. The GI performance was assessed for percentage reduction of stormwater volumes in the combined sewers. The study found that the different treatments of a same set of data led to difference in the reported GI performance: 55{\%} of volume reduction from treatment one vs. 65{\%} of the volume reduction from treatment two. The analysis methods, results, and implications of how data analysis methods affect the evaluation of GI performance were discussed.},

Though understood in their respective fields of study, these diverse impacts are seldom discussed together in a format understood by a broader audience. This paper takes a first step in addressing that gap by exploring tradeoffs associated with green infrastructure practices that manage urban stormwater including urban trees, stormwater ponds, filtration, infiltration, rain gardens, and green roofs. Each green infrastructure practice type performs best under specific conditions and when targeting specific goals, but regular inspections, maintenance, and monitoring are necessary for any green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) practice to succeed. We review how each of the above practices is intended to function and how they could malfunction in order to improve how green stormwater infrastructure is designed, constructed, monitored, and maintained. Our proposed decision-making framework, using both biophysical (biological and physical) science and social science, could lead to GSI projects that are effective, cost efficient, and just.},

abstract = {Reduction of storm-water volumes through infiltration is becoming a commonly applied practice in the effort to mitigate the negative hydrologic impacts commonly associated with land development. The hydrologic impacts generally include increases in both the volume and peak flow rate of runoff along with an associated decrease in groundwater recharge. Infiltration best management practices (BMPs) are the foundation of many low impact development and Green infrastructure practices. As the movement to volume reduction is a relatively recent concept, there remains a lack of detailed long-term monitoring data to support the implementation of storm-water infiltration BMPs. Two storm-water infiltration BMPs on the campus of Villanova University located in Southeastern Pennsylvania have been continuously monitored to determine the long-term and seasonal variation related to the engineered infiltration of storm-water runoff. The analysis of continuous monitoring data indicates that both BMPs show considerable seasonal variation but exhibit no evidence of a systematic decrease in performance to date. The seasonal variation of the BMPs is explained primarily by the temperature dependency of the viscosity of water. {\textcopyright} 2008 ASCE.},
