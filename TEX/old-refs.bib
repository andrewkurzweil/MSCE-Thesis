abstract = {Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since their initial definition. The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic TimeWarping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.},

abstract = {Urban stormwater runoff is a growing contributor to the impairment of surface waters. Nature-based technologies, including green roofs, vegetated swales, grassed filter strips, bioretention, and pervious pavements have been demonstrated to be effective in mitigating detrimental runoff characteristics. Lacking, however, has been a fundamental engineering analysis approach to these technologies. Current design guidance is based on empirical recommendations and most performance data are based on limited, localized observations. Flow balances, including infiltration, evapotranspiration and surface discharge, based on fundamental fluid dynamics principles can be employed through analysis to understand flow management. Water quality improvements will occur through a specific unit processes or mechanisms, including sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, biotransformation, bio-uptake, and heat transfer. The performance of a specific technology will depend on the facility configuration and makeup, climate, surrounding soil characteristics, topography, and the site hydrology. Applying fundamental flow and water quality processes to storm water management technologies will allow quantitative design and predictable performance characterization.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Green infrastructure designed to address urban drainage and water quality issues is often deployed without full knowledge of potential unintended social, ecological, and human health consequences. Though understood in their respective fields of study, these diverse impacts are seldom discussed together in a format understood by a broader audience. This paper takes a first step in addressing that gap by exploring tradeoffs associated with green infrastructure practices that manage urban stormwater including urban trees, stormwater ponds, filtration, infiltration, rain gardens, and green roofs. Each green infrastructure practice type performs best under specific conditions and when targeting specific goals, but regular inspections, maintenance, and monitoring are necessary for any green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) practice to succeed. We review how each of the above practices is intended to function and how they could malfunction in order to improve how green stormwater infrastructure is designed, constructed, monitored, and maintained. Our proposed decision-making framework, using both biophysical (biological and physical) science and social science, could lead to GSI projects that are effective, cost efficient, and just.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Many types of structural stormwater best management practice (BMP) have been employed since the late 1990s in the hope of mitigating the impervious surface hydrology (indicated by, e.g., high runoff volume and peak flow rates, sewer and ditch runoff conveyance, and short time to peak flow) and deteriorating water quality due to land development and human activities. It is time to examine the status of the BMP deployment from an infrastructure perspective and reflect the best strategies for low-impact development (LID). This paper presents a 22-month field investigation for 279 structural BMPs and 227 major outfalls (defined as storm drain outfall pipes with an equivalent diameter of 91 cm or larger) along highways in Prince George's County, Maryland, an area that has LID BMP research and employment history for decades. This study offers a snapshot about the state and effectiveness of structural BMPs in mitigating highway runoff in this region. The results indicate that the majority of structural BMPs deployed along the regional highway system are infiltration trenches and stormwater ponds, both of which need extensive maintenance. Due to safety concerns for traveling vehicles, fast runoff conveyance and end-of-pipe treatment are sometimes required in highway systems, prompting challenges for the LID designs. Stormwater discharged from 51{\%} of the major outfalls is not treated, indicating strong demands for stormwater green infrastructure expansion and retrofit. This paper identifies general problems and maintenance needs of different highway structural BMP designs as well as providing recommendations for improvement to engineers and highway administrators.},

abstract = {Environmental observations are fundamental to hydrology and water resources, and the way these data are organized and manipulated either enables or inhibits the analyses that can be performed. The Observations Data Model presented here provides a new and consistent format for the storage and retrieval of point environmental observations in a relational database designed to facilitate integrated analysis of large data sets collected by multiple investigators. Within this data model, observations are stored with sufficient ancillary information (metadata) about the observations to allow them to be unambiguously interpreted and to provide traceable heritage from raw measurements to useable information. The design is based upon a relational database model that exposes each single observation as a record, taking advantage of the capability in relational database systems for querying based upon data values and enabling cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis. This paper presents the design principles and features of the Observations Data Model and illustrates how it can be used to enhance the organization, publication, and analysis of point observations data while retaining a simple relational format. The contribution of the data model to water resources is that it represents a new, systematic way to organize and share data that overcomes many of the syntactic and semantic differences between heterogeneous data sets, thereby facilitating an integrated understanding of water resources based on more extensive and fully specified information.

@article{Hannachi2007,
abstract = {Climate and weather constitute a typical example where high dimensional and complex phenomena meet. The atmospheric system is the result of highly complex interactions between many degrees of freedom or modes. In order to gain insight in understanding the dynamical/physical behaviour involved it is useful to attempt to understand their interactions in terms of a much smaller number of prominent modes of variability. This has led to the development by atmospheric researchers of methods that give a space display and a time display of large space-time atmospheric data. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were first used in meteorology in the late 1940s. The method, which decomposes a space-time field into spatial patterns and associated time indices, contributed much in advancing our knowledge of the atmosphere. However, since the atmosphere contains all sorts of features, e.g. stationary and propagating, EOFs are unable to provide a full picture. For example, EOFs tend, in general, to be difficult to interpret because of their geometric properties, such as their global feature, and their orthogonality in space and time. To obtain more localised features, modifications, e.g. rotated EOFs (REOFs), have been introduced. At the same time, because these methods cannot deal with propagating features, since they only use spatial correlation of the field, it was necessary to use both spatial and time information in order to identify such features. Extended and complex EOFs were introduced to serve that purpose. Because of the importance of EOFs and closely related methods in atmospheric science, and because the existing reviews of the subject are slightly out of date, there seems to be a need to update our knowledge by including new developments that could not be presented in previous reviews. This review proposes to achieve precisely this goal. The basic theory of the main types of EOFs is reviewed, and a wide range of applications using various data sets are also provided.

These concepts are used to construct an ellipsoid in three-dimensional phase space, then points lying outside the ellipsoid are designated as spikes. The new method is shown to have superior performance to various other methods and it has the added advantage that it requires no parameters. Several methods for replacing sequences of spurious data are presented. A polynomial fitted to good data on either side of the spike event, then interpolated across the event, is preferred by the authors.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure practices are being implemented as a sustainable way to manage stormwater. Many communities are implementing green infrastructure practices on their own and in conjunction with gray infrastructure upgrades as an adaptation tool to mitigate risks and increase resilience in the face of climate change. Using a risk-based approach for design and planning has been common practice in flood control, but is not common in green infrastructure design. A risk-based approach for analyzing the performance of bioinfiltration practices was developed to assist in design and evaluation of performance over time. Bioinfiltration practices are vegetated basins that capture and retain runoff through infiltration and evapotranspiration without the use of an underdrain. Bioinfiltration facilities with varied ponding depths, media depths, and native soil saturated hydraulic conductivity based on regional design guidelines, and a field-calibrated site, were modeled over a 30-year period and compared to a predevelopment condition as the target design performance, which defined the acceptable risk. In this analysis, risk was determined for each bioinfiltration design based on the product of the probability of a rainfall event occurring, the probability of an overflow event occurring, and the average volume of overflow; the terms used to define risk can be modified to reflect local priorities. Cumulative annual risk for bioinfiltration designs was compared to acceptable risk to determine appropriate design. Results indicated that designs with increased ponding depth decreased cumulative risk. Designs with higher native soil hydraulic conductivity had reduced risk when compared to a predevelopment scenario and observed in the field-calibrated bioinfiltration site. The risk-based approach provides a helpful tool for municipal separate storm sewer system communities and combined sewer communities for design and evaluation of bioinfiltration practices.},

abstract = {Roads, highways, and developed land can alter hydrologic pathways, cause erosion and pollution to nearby waters. Best management practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce adverse effects of post-construction runoff (e.g., peak flows and runoff volumes). By applying the personal computer stormwater management model (PCSWMM), this study took an idealized catchment area approach to evaluate the performance of linear BMP alternatives for retaining the first inch of stormwater runoff from highways and roads in Illinois. Various combinations of BMPs consisting of vegetated filter strip, bioswale, and/or infiltration trench were analyzed. Two types of grass covers were considered: prairie grass and turf grass. One-inch of 24-h accumulated rainfall was used for all of evaluated scenarios. The sizes and dimensions of the evaluated BMPs were extracted from Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) projects. Stormwater runoff from combined post-BMP construction under the two different grass covers were compared to pre-BMP construction under the condition of bare soil cover. Results indicated that runoff reduction ranges from 96 to 99{\%} for combination of vegetated filter strip-bioswale, 89 to 100{\%} for vegetated filter strip-infiltration trench, and 100{\%} for bioswale-infiltration trench. Results also showed that prairie grass cover is more effective than turf grass in reducing runoff from various soil types. Findings from this study can benefit DOT to develop cost-effective solutions to manage storm runoff from roads and highways.},

Various designs have been tested including those that rely on underdrains, have internal water storage (IWS) layers, or are underdrain-free. The cells provide a range of watershed practice size ratios and employ a variety of land covers. Researchers are pooling water quantity and quality data to help create new design standards. Initial results from the shared data will be presented, with specific attention to bioretention design parameters that control flow modification and water quality improvement. Two bioretention cells of varying vegetative cover are being monitored in Rocky Mount, NC. This site is located in the upper coastal plain with sandy in-situ soils. These cells were designed with a 0.9 m media depth and a 0.6 m deep internal water storage (IWS) layer. Another bioretention cell is being monitored in Silver Spring, MD. It was constructed with a 0.9 m media depth and a 0.3 m pooling depth. Finally, there are two bioinfiltration cells being monitored in Villanova, PA. The first is the "Traffic Island" bioinfiltration cell, which has been monitored since 2003. The bowl is only designed for 1.2 cm over the impervious surface, yet overflow rarely occurs for events less than 5.1 cm. The site had groundwater wells installed in 2007 and is the subject of an ongoing study on the groundwater effects. The second site has only been monitored for approximately six months. Cumulatively, the four bioretention cells extensively examined have dramatically reduced outflow volumes, completely assimilating all events less than 1.2 cm - and in some designs much greater events. By aggregating the data, runoff reduction by bioretention can be profound. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {Water quality treatment via constructed storm-water wetlands (CSWs) is intimately linked to system hydraulics. Previous works have attempted to define the relationship between performance and wetland design variables (e.g., length, width, area). However, these works suffer from two major flaws: small sample size and/or nonrandom samples. The authors provide a framework herein to overcome these flaws. The goals of this research were to develop a methodology for creating randomly generated wetlanddesigns and to use these designs to develop a set of equations for predicting peak flow reduction. Two thousand randomly generated wetland designs were generated using a five-tiered approach. Channel length and roughness were highly correlated with peak flow reduction and explained 83{\%} of the total variability within the data set. Because of the large number of randomly generated designs, the regression equations presented herein prevent bias toward nonrandom designs. These equations represent the most general predictive performance equations developed to date and can be used to aid in CSW design. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

abstract = {Equations that relate drainage area to bankfull discharge and channel characteristics (such as width, depth, and cross-sectional area) at gaged sites are needed to help define bankfull discharge and channel characteristics at ungaged sites and can be used in stream-restoration and protection projects, stream-channel classification, and channel assessments. These equations are intended to serve as a guide for streams in areas of similar hydrologic, climatic, and physiographic conditions. New York State contains eight hydrologic regions that were previously delineated on the basis of high-flow (flood) characteristics. This report seeks to increase understanding of the factors affecting bankfull discharge and channel characteristics to drainage-area size relations in New York State by providing an in-depth analysis of seven previously published regional bankfull-discharge and channel-characteristics curves. Stream-survey data and discharge records from 281 cross sections at 82 streamflow-gaging stations were used in regression analyses to relate drainage area to bankfull discharge and bankfull-channel width, depth, and cross-sectional area. The R2 and standard errors of estimate of each regional equation were compared to the R2 and standard errors of estimate for the statewide (pooled) model to determine if regionalizing data reduced model variability. It was found that regional models typically yield less variable results than those obtained using pooled statewide equations, which indicates statistically significant regional differences in bankfull-discharge and channel-characteristics relations. All but two of the bankfull-discharge curves are within the 95-percent confidence interval bands of the statewide model; all the models have statistically similar slopes, and only one model has a unique intercept. Regional variations in channel-characteristics models of bankfull width, depth, and cross-sectional area were more prevalent than for bankfull discharge, though the magnitude of the differences varied. It was hypothesized that some regional variability could be reduced by creating models for streams with similar physiographic and climatic characteristics. Available data on streamflow patterns and previous regional-curve research suggested that mean annual runoff, Rosgen stream type, and slope were the variables most likely to influence regional bankfull discharge and channel characteristics to drainage-area size relations. Results showed that although all of these factors had an influence on regional relations, most stratified models have lower R2 values and higher standard errors of estimate than the regional models. The New York statewide (pooled) bankfull-discharge equation and equations for regions 4 and 7 were compared with equations for four other regions in the Northeast to evaluate region-to-region differences, and assess the ability of individual curves to produce results more accurate than those that would be obtained from one model of the northeastern United States. Results indicated that model slopes lack significant differences, though intercepts are significantly different. Comparison of bankfull-discharge estimates using different models shows that results could vary by as much as 100 percent depending on which model was used and indicated that regionalization improved model accuracy.},

In this research, a unique type of Sharp-Crested V-notch weir, entitled SCVW, has been introduced. The hydraulic characteristics of the present weir were investigated theoretically and experimentally under free aerated and non-aerated flow conditions in an open channel for large physical models. To investigate the variations of the discharge coefficient of SCVW versus weir height and vertex angle, a comprehensive laboratory experiments were conducted by measuring the discharge and the water head over the crest of weir. Possibility of different formulations for the head- discharge relationship of SCVW was examined and suitable analytical equation was proposed. The computed discharge using the suggested equation was within 0–10{\%} of the observed ones. According to the experimental observations, the SCVW showed better performance in comparison with normal wire.},

We conducted a systematic PubMed search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of precipitation-related floods, among Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Research identifying  flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood, those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-, during, and post-flood. Additional research is required to identify the risk factors associated with pre- and post-flood mortality and post-flood morbidity, preferably using prospective cohort studies.},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

abstract = {Fault rocks can function as barriers to subsurface fluid flow and affect the storage of CO2 in geological structures. Even though flow across faults often involves more than one fluid phase, it is typically modeled using only single-phase functions due to a lack of fault rock relative permeability data and complexities in incorporating two-phase flow properties into flow simulations. Here we present two-phase fluid flow data for cataclastic fault rocks in porous sandstone from the 90-Fathom fault (northeast England). The study area represents a field analogue for North Sea saline aquifers of Permian–Triassic age that are currently being considered for CO2 storage. We use the experimental data to populate a synthetic model of a faulted saline aquifer to assess the impact of these fault rocks on CO2 injection. We show that even fault rocks with low clay contents and very limited quartz cementation can act as major baffles to the flow of a non-wetting phase if realistic two-phase properties are taken into account. Consequently, pressure may increase far more rapidly in the storage compartment during CO2 injection than anticipated based on models that only incorporate absolute fault rock permeabilities. To avoid high pressures, which may lead to hydrofracturing and CO2 leakage, either more complex injection strategies need to be adopted or seismic data acquired to ensure the absence of faults in aquifers selected for CO2 storage.},

With vertical arrays of four and eight three-component geophones in two monitoring wells, respectively, we were able to reliably determine source mechanisms of the strongest events with the best signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysis indicates predominantly non–double-couple source mechanisms with positive volumetric component consistent with opening cracks oriented close to expected hydraulic fracture orientation. Our observations suggest the induced events are directly the result of opening cracks by fluid injection, in contrast to many previous studies where the seismicity is interpreted to be primarily shearing caused by pore pressure diffusion into the surrounding rock or associated with shear stresses created at the hydraulic fracture tip.},

The crossed immunoelectrophoretic pattern against anti-HDL was characterized by the presence of several immunoprecipitates, in striking contrast to the pattern formed by normal HDL. One of these precipitates corresponded to a lipoprotein species dominated by apoprotein A-II (apo A-II). Zonal ultracentrifugation of cholestatic plasma showed a decrease of HDL and a disappearance of the normal delineation of HDL2 and HDL3. In addition a new component designated HDL1-C was observed. Consistent results were found at studies of the molecular size distribution of cholestatic HDL by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The lipid and apoprotein composition of isolated cholestatic HDL fractions differed considerably from normal. Most notable were the high proportions of phospholipids and free cholesterol and the occurrence of the apoprotein E (arginine-rich protein) in remarkably high amounts especially in the abnormal HDL1-C.},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing of deep shale beds to develop natural gas has caused concern regarding the potential for various forms of water pollution. Two potential pathways—advective transport through bulk media and preferential flow through fractures—could allow the transport of contaminants from the fractured shale to aquifers. There is substantial geologic evidence that natural vertical flow drives contaminants, mostly brine, to near the surface from deep evaporite sources. Interpretative modeling shows that advective transport could require up to tens of thousands of years to move contaminants to the surface, but also that fracking the shale could reduce that transport time to tens or hundreds of years. Conductive faults or fracture zones, as found throughout the Marcellus shale region, could reduce the travel time further. Injection of up to 15,000,000 L of fluid into the shale generates high pressure at the well, which decreases with distance from the well and with time after injection as the fluid advects through the shale. The advection displaces native fluids, mostly brine, and fractures the bulk media widening existing fractures. Simulated pressure returns to pre-injection levels in about 300 d. The overall system requires from 3 to 6 years to reach a new equilibrium reflecting the significant changes caused by fracking the shale, which could allow advective transport to aquifers in less than 10 years. The rapid expansion of hydraulic fracturing requires that monitoring systems be employed to track the movement of contaminants and that gas wells have a reasonable offset from faults.},

abstract = {— We consider various cases of seismicity, induced by artificial fluid injections in boreholes. Like many other authors, we support the hypothesis that to a large extent the triggering of this seismicity is caused by a diffusive process of the pore pressure relaxation in porous (or fractured), saturated rocks. We show that if this hypothesis is correct, then the spatio-temporal distributions of the seismic events must have several specific features related to the effective permeability of the rock. As a rule the fluid injection-induced seismicity obeys such features. These features can be indications of the diffusive and even hydraulic nature of the seismicity triggering process.{\P}From this point of view we analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of the late aftershocks of the Antofagasta (northern Chile) 1995 earthquake. These aftershocks were concentrated in a plane, an approximately 3 km-thick spatial zone. This thin seismogenic layer is a part of the South American subduction zone. The time-distance distribution of the aftershocks along this layer indicates that they could be triggered by a diffusion-like process. Possibly, such a process is the relaxation of the pressure perturbation caused in the pore fluid by the main Antofagasta event. We estimated the permeability required to explain the spatio-temporal distribution of the aftershocks by such a triggering mechanism. The obtained value, 60 mD, is very large. However, it is realistic for a long-time existing and large-scale fault zone.},

Today, risk is used at the failure mode level to determine a course of action and at the facility level to determine the risk exposure. Risk is also used at the program level to assign resources, budget for studies and modifications, and justify potential structural modifications to Congress. Recently, Reclamation also began using risk to assess its own performance for the Office of Management and Budget.

abstract = {The storage potential of subsurface geological systems makes them viable candidates for long-term disposal of significant quantities of CO2. The geo-mechanical responses of these systems as a result of injection processes as well as the protracted storage of CO2 are aspects that require sufficient understanding. A hypothetical model has been developed that conceptualises a typical well-reservoir system comprising an injection well where the fluid (CO2) is introduced and a production/abandoned well sited at a distant location. This was accomplished by adopting a numerical methodology (discrete element method), specifically designed to investigate the geo-mechanical phenomena whereby the various processes are monitored at the inter-particle scale. Fracturing events were simulated. In addition, the influence of certain operating variables such as injection flow rate and fluid pressure was studied with particular interest in the nature of occurring fractures and trend of propagation, the pattern and magnitude of pressure build-up at the well vicinity, pressure distribution between well regions and pore velocity distribution between well regions. Modelling results generally show an initiation of fracturing caused by tensile failure of the rock material at the region of fluid injection; however, fracturing caused by shear failure becomes more dominant at the later stage of injection. Furthermore, isolated fracturing events were observed to occur at the production/abandoned wells that were not propagated from the injection point. This highlights the potential of CO2 introduced through an injection well, which could be used to enhance oil/gas recovery at a distant production well. The rate and magnitude of fracture development are directly influenced by the fluid injection rate. Likewise, the magnitude of pressure build-up is greatly affected by the fluid injection rate and the distance from the point of injection. The DEM modelling technique illustrated provides an effective procedure that allows for more specific investigations of geo-mechanical mechanisms occurring at subsurface systems. The application of this methodology to the injection and storage of CO2 facilitates the understanding of the fracturing phenomenon as well as the various factors governing the process.},

To address this problem, we adapt the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in a novel way for multivariate time series imputation. The algorithm employs Dynamic Time Warping as distance metric instead of point-wise distance measurements. We preprocess the data with linear interpolation to create complete windows for Dynamic Time Warping. The algorithm derives global distance weights from the correlation between features and consecutively missing values are penalized by individual distance weights to reduce error transfer from linear interpolation. Finally, efficient ensemble methods improve the accuracy. Experimental results show accurate imputations on datasets with a high correlation between features. Further, our algorithm shows better results with consecutively missing values than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides well-established tools for the prediction of the velocity profiles in turbulent pipe flows. As far as industrial pipe and district heating systems are concerned, combinations of elbows are the most common pipe assemblies. Among the different pipe combinations, double elbows out-of-plane are of special interest, since they introduce strong disturbances into the flow profile and have a strong influence on many common types of flow meters. In front of a double elbow there is often another flow-disturbing installation. As a result the upstream conditions are unknown and an investigation of the resulting systematic bias on the measurement of the flow rate and the associated contribution to its measurement uncertainty is necessary. We demonstrate here that this can be achieved by a variation of the inlet profile in terms of swirls and asymmetry components. In particular, an ultrasonic and an electromagnetic flow meter are modeled in order to quantify the systematic errors stemming from uncertain inflow conditions. For this purpose, a generalized non-intrusive polynomial chaos method has been used in conjunction with a commercial CFD code. As the most influential parameters on the measured volume flow, the distance between the double elbow and the flow meter as well as the orientation of the flow meter are considered as random variables in the polynomial chaos approach. This approach allowed us to obtain accurate prediction of the systematic error for the ultrasonic and electromagnetic meter as functions of the distance to the double elbow. The resulting bias in the flow rate has been found to be in the range of 1.5–4.5{\%} (0.1–0.5{\%}) with a systematic uncertainty contribution of 2–2.4{\%} (0.6–0.7{\%}) for the ultrasonic (electromagnetic) flow meter if the distance to the double elbow is smaller than 40 pipe diameters. Moreover, it is demonstrated that placing the flow meters in a Venturi constriction leads to substantial decrease of the bias and the contribution to the measurement uncertainty stemming from the uncertain inflow condition.},

@techreport{Braei2020,
abstract = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been an important research field for a long time. Seminal work on anomaly detection methods has been focussing on statistical approaches. In recent years an increasing number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies on time-series. Subsequently, researchers tried to improve these techniques using (deep) neural networks. In the light of the increasing number of anomaly detection methods, the body of research lacks a broad comparative evaluation of statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods. This paper studies 20 univariate anomaly detection methods from the all three categories. The evaluation is conducted on publicly available datasets, which serve as benchmarks for time-series anomaly detection. By analyzing the accuracy of each method as well as the computation time of the algorithms, we provide a thorough insight about the performance of these anomaly detection approaches, alongside some general notion of which method is suited for a certain type of data.},

abstract = {We present a method for identifying features (time periods of interest) in data sets consisting of time-indexed model output. The method is used as a diagnostic to quickly focus the attention on a subset of the data before further analysis methods are applied. Mathematically, the infinity norm errors of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) reconstructions are calculated for each time output. The result is an EOF reconstruction error map which clearly identifies features as changes in the error structure over time. The ubiquity of EOF-type methods in a wide range of disciplines reduces barriers to comprehension and implementation of the method. We apply the error map method to three different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data sets as examples: the development of a spontaneous instability in a large amplitude internal solitary wave, an internal wave interacting with a density profile change, and the collision of two waves of different vertical mode. In all cases the EOF error map method identifies relevant features which are worthy of further study.},

@article{Shaw2019,
abstract = {We present a computationally inexpensive, flexible feature identification method which uses a comparison of time series to identify a rank-ordered set of features in geophysically-sourced data sets. Many physical phenomena perturb multiple physical variables nearly simultaneously, and so features are identified as time periods in which there are local maxima of absolute deviation in all time series. Unlike other available methods, this method allows the analyst to tune the method using their knowledge of the physical context. The method is applied to a data set from a moored array of instruments deployed in the coastal environment of Monterey Bay, California, and a data set from sensors placed within the submerged Yax Chen Cave System in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico. These example data sets demonstrate that the method allows for the automated identification of features which are worthy of further study.},
